          <center> <h3>If your business is listed with Equifax Small Business you can either order your report online as outlined in Task #1 or you can get a free copy the old fashion way.
<br><br>
By phone – You can call 1-800-727-8495 to be mailed a free copy, but only after your business has applied for credit with a lender or supplier that shares data with Equifax Small Business within the last 60 days. Lenders will not pull your company’s Equifax report without your authorization so you should know when a lender or supplier has requested it. Remember, whether your company was approved or denied credit, only that you applied entitles you to a free report.
<br><br>
By mail – You can get a free copy of your Equifax Small Business Credit Report, even if you haven’t applied for any type of business in the last 60 days by mailing your request to the following address: Equifax P.O. Box 740249 Atlanta, GA 30374-0249
<br><br>
Your request letter should say, Please forward me a copy of the available commercial credit report for: and then provide the exact legal name of your business, business address, EIN number, business phone number, and owner name.
<br><br>
Remember, if your business is less than a year old and it hasn’t applied for credit then most likely your company does not have a listing. But, even if you haven’t applied for any type of credit but your company is more than a year old than you may have a business listing but it labeled as an empty file.</h3> </center>
