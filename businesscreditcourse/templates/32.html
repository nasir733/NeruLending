          <center> <h3>A company's Paydex速 score is directly tied to its D&B business credit report. Similar to your personal FICO速 score, it's a statistical measurement of your company's creditworthiness based on reporting trade lines. Paydex速 score ranges from 0-100, with 90-100 considered excellent; 80 and below rated as good; and 70 and below rated as poor.
<br><br>
You will need to aim for at least an 80+ score to qualify for most business finance programs. In order to accomplish this you'll need at least three trade references to generate a score but we recommend at least five (5) trade references reporting to D&B for starters.
<br><br>
Ultimately your goal should be to have 8-10 trade references reporting on each of your company's business credit reports for optimal depth, history and diversity.</h3> </center>
