You can use it for a business mailing address which is a separate address. You can use your home address for business credit building, but be aware that some lenders will not fund “home based” businesses. This will not stop you from building business credit scores, but may limit your funding options. <br><br>
The best way to know if the address you are using will work or not is to test it using Experian’s address verification tool. If the address shows “residential or mail stop” it is something you should fix. If the address comes back as “business or unknown”, you are fine using that address for your business./h3> </center>
