In order to maximize your funding potential and build a business credit profile that is separate from your personal credit you need to form a corporation or LLC. Once youâ€™ve formed a separate legal entity for your business, you must make sure everything relating to the business is done in the business name. Although you may need to personally sign for certain transaction as an authorized officer of the business, your corporation or LLC is actually the one doing business.</h3> </center>
