There is no shortage of sources in the marketplace that can provide you with a merchant account, a processing gateway and any necessary equipment so you can accept credit cards from your customers. In fact, your bank will more than likely want to be that merchant solution for your business.
<br><br>
However, itâ€™s important to explore your options before setting up a merchant account with your bank. If may be convenient but can also limit your financing and credit options. For example, there are several funding programs based on merchant processing and not on standard credit underwriting.</h3> </center>
