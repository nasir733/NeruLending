However, it's safe to say a large portion of their risk scoring model is based on making payments on time and keeping your company's report free from any public records, collections, or excessive credit inquiries. The score used for businesses is known as the Small Business Credit Risk Score. To view a sample score report click on the download file below.</h3> </center>
